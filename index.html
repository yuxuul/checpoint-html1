    <section id="About"><h2><strong>Here is a time line of Dr.Bor<span>laug's</span> life:</strong></h2>
<ol>
    <li><b>1914</b> - Born in Cresco, Iowa </li><br>
    <li><b>1933</b> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota,<br> thanks to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth <br> Administration"</li><br>
    <li><b>1935</b> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian <br> Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed <br> them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li><br>
    <li><b>1937</b> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service </li><br>
    <li><b>1938</b> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget <br> cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under <br> Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants. </li><br>
    <li><b>1941</b> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is <br> rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT <br> to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</li><br>
    <li><b>1942</b> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li><br>
    <li><b>1944</b> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his <br> pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. <br>
        Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease <br> resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li><br>
    <li><b>1945</b> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li><br>
    <li><b>1953</b> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling <br> American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on <br>
        to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li><br>
    <li><b>1962</b> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the <br> Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly <br> expanding population</li><br>
    <li><b>1970</b> - receives the Nobel Peace Price </li><br>
    <li><b>1983</b> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and <br> sorghum yields</li><br>
    <li><b>1984</b> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li><br>
    <li><b>2005</b> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." <br>
        argues that genetically modited crops are the only way we can meet the <br> demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently <br> dangerous because we've been genetically mocuying plants and animals <br> for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the <br> best breeds.</li><br>
    <li><b>2009</b> - dies at the age of 95.</li><br>
    <br>

    "Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching <br> contribution that one man's towering intellect, persistence and scientific <br> vision can make to human peace and progress." <br>

<section id="Resume"><h2><strong>Resume <span>of</span>  Dr.Borlaud </strong></h2>
    Dr. Norman Borlaug (1914–2009) was an American agronomist known as the “Father of the Green Revolution.” <br>He developed high-yield, disease-resistant wheat varieties and promoted modern agricultural techniques,<br> significantly increasing food production in Mexico, India, and Pakistan. His work helped prevent famines and is credited with saving over a billion lives. <br> In 1970, he received the Nobel Peace Prize for his contributions to global food security. Borlaug continued advocating for agricultural advancements,<br> including efforts to improve farming in Africa. His legacy remains one of the most impactful in the fight against world hunger.
